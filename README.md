# TronLightCycles   

A Javascript web-game recreating the classic _light cycle_ battle from the movie Tron. The goal of the game is to force your opponent to collide with trail created by your _light cycle_ as it traverses the arena.

## MVP List  
1. Functional movement and "trail" drawing
2. Styling of the arena, light cycles and trails
3. Game mechanics with win and loss conditions
4. AI opponents that actively attempt to encircle the human player in their trails
5. (bonus) Pseudo-3D graphics  

## Technologies  
Vanilla Javascript, possibly 3.js for graphics, no backend (unless I implement a leaderboard).
